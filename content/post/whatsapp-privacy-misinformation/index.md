WhatsApp is the most frequently used instant messaging in my home country, Turkey. This is why it wasn't surprising at all to see that the news about the [recent update to the app's Privacy Policy](https://www.whatsapp.com/legal/updates/privacy-policy/?lang=en) was a big deal, even bigger than Covid-19 for a brief moment. With this post, I aim to document my observations of this phenomena from the persective of my family and friends, with whom I keep in touch with almost exclusively through WhatsApp. These personal experiences triggered the burning desire in me to find answers to some big questions and concerns I've been thinking on and off in the recent years related to subjects such as the spread of misinformation and human-technology interaction. If wrote, I thought, I could at least create a checkpoint in my mind to get back to when I am finally motivated to really think through some solution alternatives to these problem areas.

I must let you know that I will not publicly take side in the debate of whether one should quit WhatsApp or not. I'm a industrial engineer by training and a machine learning researcher/engineer for the living and I don't believe it's my responsibility to provide a definitive answer to this debate.

## The Great Migration Away from WhatsApp
To the best of my knowledge, January 4th 2021 is when WhatsApp announced it new privacy policy. For a few days, most of the people in Turkey were rather unaware about this, including my friends and family. A few days later, I saw this trending topic in [EksiSozluk](https://eksisozluk.com)(you can think of this as Reddit of Turkey) whose title can be roughly translated to: *January 9th 2021, The Great Migration Away from WhatsApp*. The discussion post was explaining how a lot of of people decided to switch to alternatives such as Telegram or Signal (and even locally developed alternatives) as a reaction to the updated news policy. If something becomes trend topic in EksiSozluk, there is a good chance that it will soon become mainstream in Turkey. 

And it finally did became mainstream. According the the Turkish state-run new agency, by 10th of January 2021, [millions of people had already switched to alternative messaging apps in a very short period of time](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/turkey/turkey-local-messaging-apps-boom-after-whatsapp-update/2105123).

By that time, there has been discussions among my college and high school friend groups in WhatsApp about whether a switch should be made from one app to another. The audience here is mostly college educated group of people in their late 20s.

My family groups (nuclear family as well as the extended groups of Mom's side and Dad's side) were unaware up to this point. These groups have typically an older audience and you won't typically find many tech-savvy people in them.

Then came the mysterious voice message and the text wall arrived from two of these groups, both shared by my 65+ year old parents...

There are terryfying commonalities between these two messages:
- **Anonymity**: They were completely anonymous. One was a voice message and the person who recorded it did not bother introducing himself. The other was a black on white font text wall.
- **Immediate Threat**: Both messages start with a statement of what the "immediate threat" and how it's poised to change everything fundamentally.
- **Conspiracy**: Both messages paint a picture of a "mastermind behind a grandoise plan", sprinkling their arguments with a bunch of techno-political statements. 
- **Call-to-Action**: Both messages conclude with a similar call-to-action statement.

For those who don't speak Turkish, let me translate the key parts of both messages. I will not fact-check the information here, will leave it to the you as an exercise of civic duty.

### The Text Wall
{{< figure src="PHOTO-2021-01-09-22-38-40.jpg" >}}

The first paragraph is mainly focused on some sort of global conspiracy theory. Some sentences are:
- *As of tomorrow, there will be new communication laws in effect in the entire world.*
- *All European, North and South American governments made an agreement with WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook so that the former will have access to the stored messaging the data possessed by the latter whenever they see fit.*
- *THIS MOVE IS INTENDED TO MONITOR ORGANIZED CRIME AND TERROR.* (direct translation of the sentence in caps)
- *Do not share important information through these channels. Educate your children about these.*

The second paragraph is a call-to-action to share the message with friends and family for their well-being.

### The Voice Message
{{< audio src="AUDIO-2021-01-09-09-33-23.mp3" >}}
This one is even more interesting. The person in this message has an affirming voice, signaling that he is some sort of information security/machine learning/big data expert.

- He starts out by saying that he read the new privacy policy by WhatsApp.
- He says that this new policy will allow Facebook to have access to *all of our data* in WhatsApp.
- He says that the biggest threat are the voice recordings because they can be used to generate your fake voice, which can be used to access your bank account. A background information here is that most banks in Turkey now employ voice signatures for easy authentication in telebanking operations.
- He throws some numbers to be even more convincing. He says that the imitation accuracy of anyone's voice is 97%.
- He says that WhatsApp excluded EU from this policy because EU has privacy protection laws in effect while developing countries such as Turkey don't have this which makes its people vulnerable.
- He says that everyone should take this seriously becuase (in his words) "when all the data from all Facebook Companies are combined, one cannot imagine the extent to which these information can be used as a tool for political pressure".
- Like the text wall, he concludes by recommending people to share this message with their loved ones.
- He states that he will not sign this agreement and he expect people to switch to Telegram or other applications.
- Ironically, he concludes this message by saying that even this piece of voice message of his can be used to generate fake voice recordings of his, to make his statement even more clear.

Now, here comes the important part. The foundational pieces of information in both messages of which all the other arguments are based on are easily falsifiable. Yet, both messages made a serious impact on many of friends and family, and except a few, none of them bothered fact-checking and even questioning the credibility of these messages. Why did this happen?

## The Freightened, The Cynical and The Lazy
I'm not after the answer to the question of why people believe in conspiracy theories. Many people are already working on that. Instead, what I want to understand is why my relatives failed to attempt fact checking or questioning this obivously shady information they received literally out of nowhere. Why did they share it with us? Why did they decide to switch apps? 

After some thought, I decided to formulate a theory based on three personas: the Freightened, the Cynical and the Lazy. I don't argue that everyone falls into one and exactly one category but I rather think there is a mix of a multiple of personas in action in each person. I created these personas, mainly drawing inspiration from the dialogues I had with my loved ones over the weekend.

The Freightened is clearly the most sensitive to the Immediate Threat in those messages. If you have your entire savings in your bank account, you clearly don't want these to be siphoned away from you by some hacker with a voice recongition tool. Likewise, if you are in a country with a bad track record of freedom-of-speech and the government is not necessarily run by your favorite political party, you don't want them to be monitoring your rightful exercise of free speech with your loved ones about country matters. I suspect the Freightened is so consumed by this that s/he immediately skips to Call-to-Action by switching to the other app and sharing this information (through WhatsApp) to protect her/his loved ones. S/he cannot waste time trying to fact check this information whatsoever.

The Cynical is the early adopter of the Conspiracy. S/he's not necessarily freightened by the threat but was expecting yet another attempt by higher powers to infringe upon her/his and her/his fellow citizens' wellbeing and freedom. Skipping fact-checking once more, s/he becomes another key node in the graph of misinformation spread. The motivations of the Cynical to spread are more heroic than the Freightened for whom it is rather a maternal/paternal protective instinct. Maybe it was important to be the first one to send this information to the loved ones.

The Lazy, unlike all the others, is not necessarily sensitive to neither the Immediate Threat nor Conspiracy. S/he simply has other priorities (or no priorities at all, in some cases where nihilism is strong) so s/he cannot be bothered with fact-checking or stopping the spread of misinformation. S/he is also quite conformative, jumping without a second-thought on to the next app just because "all the other were doing it", not because the Call-to-Action. According to my anectodal evidence, this is the largest group among my friends and family.

## Post-Trauma Personal Interactions
Through video calls, I discussed this issue in-depth with my friends and family. Given my background in machine learning and software development, I was among the most credible sources about this issue in their immediate network. I feel like this, combined with our personal connection, allowed me to 

## Concerns, Beyond Messaging Privacy
The moral of the story is that, I am deeply concerned about this and for reasons beyond messaging privacy. The three personas collectively represent a big chunk of my personal network which makes it a hotbed for spread of misinformation. A simple discussion about whether to use WhatsApp or not may not be fundamentally important for us but as we observe similar phenomena with other, more important issues, it might have more catastrophic consequences. I hope to be personally more vigilant about this behavior.
