I am a doctoral candidate at ASU's School of Computing, Information and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE). I am currently at the "all but dissertation" stage of my doctoral degree. I am expected to receive my degree in the Summer of 2021. 

If you are here, you're probably looking for some serious stuff such as links to my publications, talks, projects etc. Feel free to explore and reach out to me about any question you have in mind. Even though this blog has mostly serious stuff, I intend to put more fun stuff once I finally manage to finish my Ph.D. and hopefully have a more stable work-life balance.

Speaking of fun stuff, I love sailing. Ever since I first capsized in a bathtub-sized [Optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimist_(dinghy)) when I was a little kid, it has been my favorite pastime activity. I also proudly served as a board member at [Bogazici University Sailing and Maritime Society](http://yelken.boun.edu.tr) throughout my undergrad. That gave me opportunity to spread the love by teaching people sailing both on the water and in front of the blackboard.

Other than going sailing, I like reading about a wide range of topics, from philosophy to politics, history, and art. I believe keeping the range wide open helps me understand them better collectively by drawing connections between them.

Here are the stuff that I'm currently reading, thinking, pondering, wasting time about:
- How can we learn lessons from this pandemic and be better prepared for a creeping climate disaster?
- How to (actively) model human preferences?
- Electronic music, all the way from music theory to sound design
