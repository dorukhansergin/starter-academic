Hi! I'm so glad you found this website! I hope you find interesting stuff in here. My name is Dorukhan and I build machine learning products for a living. After getting my PhD in Industrial Engineering at Arizona State University (with a focus on Machine Learning), I decided to move onto the industry to be more hands-on with building machine learning products.

This blog is meant to serve two purposes: (1) my public journal, (2) a collection of my learnings that I want to share publicly. If there are topics that you'd want me to cover, reach me out through LinkedIn or email.

Here are the stuff that I'm currently reading, thinking, pondering, wasting time about:
- How can we expand from the scientific consensus on climate change and turn it into a global metanarrative so that we can start globally start addressing it?
- What can we learn from the history about growing income inequality to make sure we make a smooth transition into a more equal society?
- Is there free-will? (Yes, I'm still not over that topic.)
- Machine Learning System Design best practices.
- Opportunities for sailing in NYC!
