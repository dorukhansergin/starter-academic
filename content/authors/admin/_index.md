I am a Graduate Research Assistant at ASU's School of Computing, Information and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE). I am currently at the "all but dissertation" stage of my doctoral degree. I am expected to receive my degree in the Summer of 2021. 

I interned at Apple Inc. as a Machine Learning Engineer between June and December of 2020 where I built machine learning and computer vision solutions for the factory floor.

Throughout my doctorate, I did research in a number of areas. My major research focuses on the use of deep (probabilistic) neural networks in the context of statistical process control and fault classification in manufacturing settings. My work appeared in IEEE CASE 2019 and INFORMS 2020.

I also worked on tensor decomposition techniques to model complex spatiotemporal systems. A related conference paper where I co-authored appeared in AAAI 2020.

During my M.S. degree in Bogazici University I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant in the European Union funded [ARTS Project](http://acceleratingtransitions.eu), which aims to understand the role of and empower grassroots organizations that promote carbon-neutral lifestyle in European cities. The project is dear to my heart as I am personally quite concerned about climate change. For this project, I built computational social simulation tools and serious games to facilitate policy discussions. 

For my master's dissertation, I pivoted from simulation to machine learning and focused on the problem of multivariate time-series classification.

Ever since I first capsized in a bathtub-sized [Optimist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimist_(dinghy)) when I was a little kid on my first day of sailing, it has been my favorite pastime activity. I also proudly served as a board member at [Bogazici University Sailing and Maritime Society](http://yelken.boun.edu.tr) throughout my undergrad. That gave me opportunity to spread the love by teaching people sailing both on the water and in front of the blackboard.

Other than going sailing, I like reading about a wide range of topics, from philosophy to politics, history, and art. Keeping the range wide-open helps me understand all of them better by drawing connections between them.
